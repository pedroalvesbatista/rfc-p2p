Start Listning:
1. Listen to all the crap that's coming in. Can be fro m different peers at the same time. Assumption is that one whole packet is received at one time. 

For example, we can get

ADD by peer 1
LOOKUP by peer 2
Add by peer 3

IF: This all is stored in one string. 

Read line by line. 
When you read first line, read the next three lines. Do one action. (method call based what the request type is)
Read another line, then read the next three lines, do another action. 


AddToIndex(String packet){
This will be given a complete packet. 
This will do what it's supposed to. 
}
